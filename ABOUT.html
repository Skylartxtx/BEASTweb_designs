            <p>The four divine beasts hold a high position in traditional Chinese culture. They guard the four directions geographically, bless all living beings in the cycle of time, and represent good luck, peace, joy, and good wishes.
                Although we are not superstitious, the images of the Four Gods are still so beautiful and a crystallization of wisdom, which should be understood and appreciated by future generations.
                However, due to various obstacles such as language, culture, geographical location, damage, etc., the treasures enshrined in museums are difficult for people from all over the world to appreciate.
                Adhering to the two basic principles of "cultural equality" and "national is the world", we hope to use this website to bring you auspicious blessings and revive the treasure.</p>
       
            <strong>I hope you can learn more about traditional culture through this website, and also hope to spread traditional Chinese aesthetics through cultivating sentiment, so as not to let the pearl dust.</strong>

            <p >Hello lovely visitor, nice to meet you here.
                I believe you are just as obsessed with traditional culture as I am.
                I believe that regardless of which country, their culture is equally splendid, without distinction between high and low.
                The thousands of years of inheritance make them appear precious, but they are easily forgotten. If you are committed to protecting traditional culture or interested in it like me, you can contact me through the following methods. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
